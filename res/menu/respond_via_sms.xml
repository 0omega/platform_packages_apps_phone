<!-- TODO: still need product / UX decision about whether the user will be
     allowed to to manage or customize the canned messages.  For now, keep
     these messages here in a static <menu>.  (But I'll probably need to
     build the menu dynamically at some point, which means that these
     canned messages will probably move over to res/values/array.xml.) -->
