    <!-- Amount of vertical space to reserve for the in-call button cluster
         at the bottom of the screen.
         This is used as the bottom margin for the "call info container"
         of the in-call UI, to prevent the call info from overlapping with
         the button cluster.

         This value is used during most call states.  However, if an
         incoming call is ringing, we use in_call_control_height_incoming
         instead since the incoming-call widget takes up more vertical
         space than the regular button cluster. -->

    <!-- Amount of vertical space to reserve for the MultiWaveView widget
         while an incoming call is ringing.
         This is used as the bottom margin for the "call info container"
         of the in-call UI while an incoming call is ringing, to prevent
         the call info from overlapping with the incoming-call widget.

         The incoming-call widget takes up more vertical space than the
         regular in-call button cluster, so this value is larger than
         in_call_control_height_active. -->

         risk of false touches (from your finger wrapping around while
